# IRThermometer
Arduino based thermometer with infrared output.

I wanted a thermometer that could be read by a camera remotely. I decided to use infrared LEDs so that they're not visible to the naked eye but will be to the camera. Then I decided that the output should be in binary, rather than integer digits, because that sounded fun.
