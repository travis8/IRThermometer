# IRThermometer
Arduino based thermometer with infrared output.

I wanted a thermometer that could be read by a camera remotely. I decided to use infrared LEDs so that they're not visible to the naked eye but will be to the camera. Then I decided that the output should be in binary, rather than integer digits, because that sounded fun. A regular old mercury type thermometer would have worked just fine but I decided to spend twice the moeny and way more time building this one instead because I thought it would be more fun. And it was. Plus this one can be more easily read by a camera with poor resolution. Simply space out the LEDs to make it easier to read.
